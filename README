This is a version of barrett-ros-pkg that's compatible with newer ROS (tested
with Igloo. Should be compatible with any version that uses catkin.)

In short, the changes I've made to the original barrett-ros-pkg
(http://web.barrett.com/svn/barrett-ros-pkg/trunk/) are:
-The folder structure has been changed to be catkin compatible.
-I've included typedefs in wam_node.cpp to change older references to bullet
libraries to the ones included in ROS' tf packages. 
-I've changed the includes in wam_node.cpp to the locations generated by the
catkin workspace.
-I've created the CMakeLists for both the wam_common and wam_node packages. I've
set them up to generate the required messages and services. 

To use: 
-Create a catkin workspace. 
-Use the catkin_create_pkg function to create packages named "wam_common" and 
"wam_node" under the workspace's src directory. Copy the contents of the
included folders into these.
-I had to link to eigen2, xenomai, libbarrett, and libgsl in
wam_node/CMakeLists. You'll need to edit the CMakeFiles to point to your local
copies:
--search wam_node/CMakeLists for "xenomai", "eigen2", and "libbarrett"
--Change these paths to wherever these directories are on your computer.
